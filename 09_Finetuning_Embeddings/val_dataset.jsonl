Here\u2019s what I said in the NY TImes:\n\nSociety needs concise ways to talk about modern A.I. \u2014 both the positives and the negatives. \u2018Ignore that email, it\u2019s spam,\u2019 and \u2018Ignore that article, it\u2019s slop,\u2019 are both useful lessons.", "c2de0069-ed64-4a71-99d1-f6b47d225861": "I love the term \u201cslop\u201d because it so succinctly captures one of the ways we should not be using generative AI!\nSlop was even in the running for Oxford Word of the Year 2024, but it lost to brain rot.\nSynthetic training data works great\nAn idea that surprisingly seems to have stuck in the public consciousness is that of \u201cmodel collapse\u201d.

In organic datasets, the relationship between tokens is often complex and indirect.
