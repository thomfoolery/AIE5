        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that ranks documents based on their relevance to the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to a generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The presence of relevant information from the retrieval step helps the model generate more informed and relevant content.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and dynamic set of information, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI systems. By combining retrieval and generation, RAG models can leverage both the precision of retrieval systems and the flexibility of generative models.\""

It achieves this by adding lightweight, trainable components to the existing model layers, rather than modifying the entire model. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and the GPU memory requirements, making it efficient for adapting large language models like GPT-3. LoRA maintains or even improves model performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, without increasing inference latency.

He is known for his contributions to making large AI models more accessible by reducing their resource requirements, enabling their use in specialized domains. [More about Tim Dettmers](https://timdettmers.com/about/).\\n\\n### Attention in Machine Learning\\nAttention mechanisms in machine learning are inspired by the human cognitive process of focusing selectively on certain parts of the input data. They are crucial in tasks like language translation, where understanding the relationships between different elements in a sequence is essential. Attention mechanisms allow models to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input, improving the performance of sequence-to-sequence models.

            "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses. It involves creating input, instructional, and conversational prompts to minimize bias and improve the quality of AI outputs. This technique is crucial in various applications, including customer support, content generation, and data analysis. Prompt engineering is an iterative process that may require repeated prompting to achieve the desired results, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and cost savings ([Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/prompt-engineering), [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/prompt-engineering)).\n",

            "**History of Prompt Engineering**\n",
            "\n",
            "The history of prompt engineering can be traced back to the early days of code generation tools like CodeSmith and MyGeneration, which automated the generation of boilerplate code for common programming tasks. Over time, prompt engineering evolved with advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning techniques. These developments have enhanced the capabilities of language models, making them more powerful, context-aware, and adaptable for a wide range of NLP applications. The introduction of attention mechanisms and reinforcement learning in 2017 further improved the controllability of prompt-engineered language models, allowing engineers to shape model behavior and address biases ([Promptly Substack](https://promptly.substack.com/p/a-journey-through-the-history-of), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438)).\n",

            "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technology that enhances generative models by integrating information retrieval capabilities. It allows large language models (LLMs) to respond to user queries by referencing a specified set of documents, thereby augmenting the information drawn from these sources. This approach is particularly useful for generating more accurate and contextually appropriate responses, informative articles, personalized learning content, and improved recommendation systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "RAG was first proposed in 2020, making it a relatively new technology. Since its inception, it has gained popularity due to its ability to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. The technology has evolved to include advanced retrievers and complementary technologies, leading to more complex RAG systems. Recent research has focused on modular RAG frameworks, which decompose complex systems into independent modules, allowing for a more reconfigurable and efficient design.\n",

This allows the model to adapt to specific tasks or domains while leveraging the general knowledge it has already acquired during its initial training on a larger dataset. Fine-tuning is particularly useful because it can significantly reduce the amount of data and computational resources required to train a model for a specific task, as the model starts with a strong foundation of general knowledge.\n",

In NLP, the introduction of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 popularized the concept of fine-tuning. BERT and similar models are pre-trained on large corpora of text and then fine-tuned on specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition.\n",
