# üèóÔ∏è Activity #1 (Bonus Marks)
# 
# Allow the system to dynamically fetch Arxiv papers instead of hard coding them.
# 
# > HINT: Tuesday's assignment will be very useful here.
#
# A: See [./Multi_Agent_RAG_LangGraph.ipynb](./Multi_Agent_RAG_LangGraph.ipynb) for the solution to this activity.
# 

# ‚ùì Question #1:
# Why is a "powerful" LLM important for this use-case?
#
# A: It must consider all the context of the request in order to provide the most accurate information possible.
# 
# What tasks must our Agent perform that make it such that the LLM's reasoning capability is a potential limiter?
#
# A: Reasoning, the Agent must be able to understand the order of operations that must be performed in order to complete the request.
# 

# üèóÔ∏è Activity #2:
# 
# Using whatever drawing application you wish - please label the flow above on a diagram of your graph.
# 
# A: See [./research_graph.png](./research_graph.png) for the solution to this activity.
#

# ‚ùì Question #2:
# 
# How could you make sure your Agent uses specific tools that you wish it to use? Are there any ways to concretely set a flow through tools?
# 
# A: By creating a node that has access to only a single tool, you use a conditional edge to route the flow through that node ensuring the agent can only use that tool. 
# 

# üèóÔ∏è Activity #3:
#
# Describe, briefly, what each of these tools is doing in your own words.
# 
# - create_outline
#     This tool takes the provide array of strings(points) and writes them to a specific file(file_name)
#
# - read_document
#     This tool reads the provided document(file_name) and returns the contents between the specified start(start, default 0) and end(end, default None) line indices
#
# - write_document
#     This tool writes the provided content(content) to a specific file (file_name)
#
# - edit_document
#     This tool edits the provided document and inserts text into the document(file_name) at the specified indices(inserts)
#
